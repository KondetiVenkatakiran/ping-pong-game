Ping-Pong-Game:
***********WAYS TO GET INTO THE GAME?**********************

1. Compile client.c in a separate terminal and serverp.c in a separate terminal.
2. A name prompt will appear on the screen following the server and client's successful connection.
3. The game will begin, with a server-side first pass.


**************GAME OVERVIEW****************************-

Keyboard controls for the paddle are 'W' and 'S'.
************************** IMPORTANT NOTES

1. The system randomly serves a player from anywhere on the opposing player's court after they miss a pong shot.
2. The method just displays the winner and their score on the screens of both participants.
3. To exit the game, press 'q' on terminals.
4. The instructions stated that when the ball is on the other court, to control the paddle, use the poll or select system call.
   However, the multiple thread notion was adopted in place of those system calls, allowing the paddle to move regardless of the presence of the ball.
   
***********************************************************************


Please press 'W' or 'S' for one second to see the entire paddle on the screen.
Kindly refer to the attached video for additional clarity.
